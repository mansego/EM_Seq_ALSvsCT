# Characterization Of Circulating Cell-free Dna As A Source Of Epigenetic Biomarkers For Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Disease Diagnosis 

**Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona (UAB)** 

**Bioinformatics Master's Thesis ‚Äì 2025**

## üìå Overview 
This repository contains bioinformatics pipelines and analysis scripts for the integrative study of **cell-free DNA (cfDNA)** from **Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)** patients and healthy controls, using **Enzymatic Methyl-seq (EM-seq)** technology. The project aims to identify **ALS-associated epigenetic and fragmentation biomarkers**, investigate the **tissue origin of cfDNA**, and explore **epigenetic differences between ALS clinical phenotypes**, specifically **bulbar-onset vs spinal-onset ALS**. Analyses include genome-wide methylation profiling, fragmentomics, deconvolution of cfDNA origin, and clinical data integration.

Key analytical components include:

- **Genome-wide profiling of differentially methylated loci and regions (DMLs/DMRs) associated with ALS and ALS clinical phenotypes**.

- **Profilling cfDNA Fragmentation Patterns associated with ALS**.

- **Tissue-of-origin deconvolution using supervised and unsupervised reference-free methods**.

- **Clinical and phenotypic data integration**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Dependencies  
1. **Environment Setup**: 
Use `mamba` (recommended over conda for performance):
  ```bash
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda config --set channel_priority strict
conda install mamba

mamba create -n tfm_als -c bioconda -c conda-forge -c defaults \
  samtools picard  r-ggplot2 r-tidyverse python nextflow nf-core singularity
conda activate tfm_als
   ```
2. **R/Python Libraries**: 
  ```r
  # R packages
   install.packages(c("ggplot2", "tidyverse", "ggpubr","UpSetR", "pheatmap"))  # R  
   pip install seaborn pandas numpy     
   ```
```bash
# Python packages
pip install pandas numpy seaborn 
   ```

## üöÄ Quick Start

## üìÅ Preprocessing (nf-core/methylseq with Bismark for EM-seq)
The preprocessing of raw sequencing data was performed using the nf-core/methylseq pipeline, configured to run in **EM-seq mode** by setting the `--em_seq` true parameter. This mode optimizes the workflow specifically for Enzymatic Methyl-seq data. The human reference genome **GRCh38** was used for alignment and methylation extraction. The workflow was executed with Singularity for containerized reproducibility, and parameters were defined in an external YAML file.

The pipeline was executed as follows:
```bash
cd PrePro/
nextflow run nf-core/methylseq -profile singularity \
  -params-file params.yaml \
  -resume
```
Upon completion, the output directory contained the following subfolders:

- `bismark/`: Alignment and methylation extraction results produced by Bismark.

- `fastqc/`: Quality control reports for raw reads generated by FastQC.

- `multiqc/`: Aggregated quality control report across samples.

- `trimgalore/`: Adapter trimming and low-quality base removal results.

For additional technical details about this section of the workflow, please refer to the `README.md` file located in the [`PrePro/`](PrePro/).

## üìä Fragment Size & GC Bias Analysis
To investigate cfDNA fragmentation patterns associated with ALS, we implemented a pipeline aimed at quantifying fragment size distributions and assessing GC bias across samples. This analysis complements the methylation-based characterization by exploring cfDNA fragmentation, a feature known to reflect nucleosome positioning.

 ```bash
# 1.Extract Fragment Size from BAMs
for sample in "${ALS_SAMPLES[@]}" "${CTRL_SAMPLES[@]}"; do
  java -jar picard.jar CollectInsertSizeMetrics \
    I="/path/to/${sample}.deduplicated.sorted.bam" \
    O="fragment_analysis/stats/${sample}_insert_metrics.txt" \
    H="fragment_analysis/plots/${sample}_insert_histogram.pdf" \
    M=0.5
done
# 2. GC Bias Correction
for sample in "${ALS_SAMPLES[@]}" "${CTRL_SAMPLES[@]}"; do
java -jar picard.jar CollectGcBiasMetrics \
   I="/path/to/${sample}.deduplicated.sorted.bam" \
   O="fragment_analysis/stats/${sample}_gc_bias_metrics.txt" \
   CHART="fragment_analysis/plots/${sample}_gc_bias_chart.pdf" \
   S="fragment_analysis/stats/${sample}_gc_summary.txt" \
   R="path/to/genome.fa" \
done
  # Generate plots
    Rscript GC_bias_metrics.Rmd  

# 3. Data Aggregation and Analysis
Rscript Fragment_analysis.Rmd
```
All scripts, intermediate results, and figures are located within the [`fragment_analysis/`](fragment_analysis/) directory. For further technical details, please refer to the `README.md` file in the same folder.

## üìà Differential Methylation Analysis (DMA)
Genome-wide differential methylation analysis was conducted on EM-seq cfDNA data using the DSS package. Two comparisons were explored:

- ALS vs Control samples

- Bulbar-onset vs Spinal-onset ALS phenotypes

After rigorous quality control (SNP exclusion, coverage filtering, batch correction), the following results were obtained:
|Comparison	|Significant DMLs	|Significant DMRs|
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
|ALS vs Control|	69,749	|182|
|Bulbar vs Spinal ALS	|233	|1|

Functional enrichment (GO, KEGG, DisGeNET) highlighted neuronal and ALS-related pathways. Scripts and outputs are organized in the [`DMA/`](DMA) folder and include annotated DMLs/DMRs, volcano plots, PCA, and enrichment summaries.

## üß¨ Deconvolution of Tissue-of-Origin
To infer the cellular and tissue composition of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in plasma samples, we applied three complementary deconvolution methods adapted for cfDNA methylation data:

- **UXM** (Unsupervised reference-free)

- **DeconvR** (Reference-free)

- **HiBED** (Supervised for cfDNA tissues)

All analyses were conducted using a standardized R script:
```bash
Rscript Deconvolution/Deconvolution.R
```

Output:

- `Deconvolution/tables/`: Cell-type estimates, statistics

- `Deconvolution/figures/`: Heatmaps, barplots by phenotype (e.g., bulbar vs spinal)

For methodological and implementation details, refer to the script and documentation available in the folder:

All statistical results are derived from genome-wide methylation analysis and cfDNA deconvolution approaches. Session information and software versions used to generate these results are included in supplementary text files (`session_info_*.txt`) to ensure reproducibility.

All results were generated from EM-Seq data of cfDNA, processed using Bismark, BSseq, DSS and deconvolution tools (UXM, HiBED, DeconvR).

For reproducibility, corresponding session information is included in:

- `fragment_analysis/session_info_FA.txt`

- `fragment_analysis/session_info_GC.txt`

- `Deconvolution/session_info.txt`
