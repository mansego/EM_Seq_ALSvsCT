# Differential Methylation Analysis (DMLs and DMRs) in EM-Seq ALS vs Control

This section details the bioinformatics pipeline for identifying and analyzing Differentially Methylated Loci (DMLs) and Regions (DMRs) using Enzymatic Methyl-Seq (EM-seq) data. The analysis was performed as part of my Master's Thesis in Bioinformatics and includes two primary comparisons:

1. **ALS vs. Control samples** ‚Äì To identify methylation signatures associated with ALS pathogenesis.

2. **ALS phenotypic subgroups (Bulbar-onset vs. Spinal-onset)** ‚Äì To investigate epigenetic differences between clinical manifestations of ALS.

The pipeline encompasses read methylation calling, quality control and statistical testing for DMLs/DMRs, followed by functional enrichment analysis of significant hits.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Analysis Pipeline Overview

The DMA workflow consists of three main phases:

1. **Preprocessing & Quality Control**
2. **Differential Methylation Calling**
3. **Functional Enrichment Analysis**

### 1. Preprocessing & Quality Control

Key steps performed in [`DSS_Analysis.R`](Scripts/DSS_Analysis.R) and [`DSS_Analysis_BvsS.R`](Scripts/DSS_Analysis_BvsS.R):

- **SNP filtering**: Removed CpGs overlapping with common SNPs (MAF ‚â• 10%)
- **Coverage filtering**: Kept CpGs with ‚â•10x coverage in ‚â•4 samples per group (applied separately for ALS vs. Control and Bulbar vs. Spinal comparisons).
- **Batch correction**: Applied limma's `removeBatchEffect` to account for technical variability
- **Quality Control**:
  - Global methylation distributions (stratified by phenotype).
  - PCA of methylation profiles (highlighting ALS vs. Control and Bulbar vs. Spinal clustering).
  - Coverage uniformity across chromosomes.
  - Sample clustering analysis.

### 2. Differential Methylation Analysis

Performed using the **DSS** package with consistent parameters for both comparisons:

```r
dmr_params = list(
  delta = 0.1,          # Minimum methylation difference
  p.threshold = 1e-5,   # Significance threshold
  minlen = 50,          # Minimum DMR length (bp)
  minCG = 3,            # Minimum CpGs per DMR
  dis.merge = 100,      # Max distance to merge nearby DMRs
  pct.sig = 0.5         # Minimum proportion of significant CpGs in DMR
)
```
**Key Results:**
1. ALS vs. Control:
    - [DMLs_annotated.tsv](Results/ALSvsCT/DMLs_annotated.tsv): The 69,749 significant DML from the 2,264,336 CpGs tested, top significant DMLs

    - [DMRs_annotated.tsv](Results/ALSvsCT/DMRs_annotated.tsv): The 182 significant DMRs with genomic annotations
2. Bulbar-onset vs. Spinal-onset ALS:
    - [DMLs_annotated.tsv](Results/BulbarvsSpinal_ALS/DMLs_annotated.tsv): The 233 significant DML from the 77,864 CpGs tested, top significant DMLs

    - [DMRs_annotated.tsv](Results/BulbarvsSpinal_ALS/DMRs_annotated.tsv): The 1 significant DMRs with genomic annotations

### 3. Functional Enrichment Analysis
Performed in [methylation_enrichment_analysis.Rmd](Script/methylation_enrichment_analysis.Rmd) for*both comparisons*:

- Gene Ontology (BP, CC, MF).
- KEGG Pathway analysis.
- DisGeNET disease associations.
