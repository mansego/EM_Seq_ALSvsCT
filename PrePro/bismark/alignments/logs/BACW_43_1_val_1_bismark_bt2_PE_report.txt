Bismark report for: BACW_43_1_val_1.fq.gz and BACW_43_2_val_2.fq.gz (version: v0.24.2)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /media/ml/54e2ab4d-7887-4fc1-b62a-f962ab951051/cfNOME/pilot/methylseq/methylseq/work/stage-9f855df7-31e0-4e42-82bb-394b9dea2a05/d6/db220c2fb6583105ff7959dc51f3be/BismarkIndex/ with the specified options: -q --score-min L,0,-0.2 --ignore-quals --no-mixed --no-discordant --dovetail --maxins 1000
Option '--directional' specified (default mode): alignments to complementary strands (CTOT, CTOB) were ignored (i.e. not performed)

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequence pairs analysed in total:	205070296
Number of paired-end alignments with a unique best hit:	165880233
Mapping efficiency:	80.9% 
Sequence pairs with no alignments under any condition:	30254579
Sequence pairs did not map uniquely:	8935484
Sequence pairs which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted:	88

Number of sequence pairs with unique best (first) alignment came from the bowtie output:
CT/GA/CT:	82912991	((converted) top strand)
GA/CT/CT:	0	(complementary to (converted) top strand)
GA/CT/GA:	0	(complementary to (converted) bottom strand)
CT/GA/GA:	82967154	((converted) bottom strand)

Number of alignments to (merely theoretical) complementary strands being rejected in total:	0
