Bismark report for: BACW_63_1_val_1.fq.gz and BACW_63_2_val_2.fq.gz (version: v0.24.2)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /data/scratch/NAVA1/methylseq_3.0.0_ml/work/stage-112c7ad1-28c8-4f4e-93a2-1f893eaa87d9/35/2394f7487cb0a3bfa1f7181026d390/BismarkIndex/ with the specified options: -q --score-min L,0,-0.2 --ignore-quals --no-mixed --no-discordant --dovetail --maxins 1000
Option '--directional' specified (default mode): alignments to complementary strands (CTOT, CTOB) were ignored (i.e. not performed)

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequence pairs analysed in total:	209284391
Number of paired-end alignments with a unique best hit:	171402662
Mapping efficiency:	81.9% 
Sequence pairs with no alignments under any condition:	28036224
Sequence pairs did not map uniquely:	9845505
Sequence pairs which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted:	67

Number of sequence pairs with unique best (first) alignment came from the bowtie output:
CT/GA/CT:	85677502	((converted) top strand)
GA/CT/CT:	0	(complementary to (converted) top strand)
GA/CT/GA:	0	(complementary to (converted) bottom strand)
CT/GA/GA:	85725093	((converted) bottom strand)

Number of alignments to (merely theoretical) complementary strands being rejected in total:	0
