Bismark report for: BACW_1_val_1.fq.gz and BACW_2_val_2.fq.gz (version: v0.24.0)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /data/scratch/NAVA1/methylseq_2.6.0/work/stage-c2462557-33f5-4634-99d6-445cbb8ada6f/5a/4509f7f3224a115ee640c0b6ffd835/BismarkIndex/ with the specified options: -q --score-min L,0,-0.2 --ignore-quals --no-mixed --no-discordant --dovetail --maxins 1000
Option '--directional' specified (default mode): alignments to complementary strands (CTOT, CTOB) were ignored (i.e. not performed)

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequence pairs analysed in total:	218982993
Number of paired-end alignments with a unique best hit:	172859088
Mapping efficiency:	78.9% 
Sequence pairs with no alignments under any condition:	34636643
Sequence pairs did not map uniquely:	11487262
Sequence pairs which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted:	78

Number of sequence pairs with unique best (first) alignment came from the bowtie output:
CT/GA/CT:	86402775	((converted) top strand)
GA/CT/CT:	0	(complementary to (converted) top strand)
GA/CT/GA:	0	(complementary to (converted) bottom strand)
CT/GA/GA:	86456235	((converted) bottom strand)

Number of alignments to (merely theoretical) complementary strands being rejected in total:	0
